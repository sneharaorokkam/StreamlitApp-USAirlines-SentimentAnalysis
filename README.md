# StreamlitApp - USAirlines-sentiment analysis

## Overview
This is a Streamlit web application for sentiment analysis of tweets related to major US airlines. The application allows users to enter a Twitter username and retrieve the sentiment analysis of their recent tweets. Sentiment analysis is performed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and the results are visualized using Plotly charts.

## Project Structure and Tasks

This project is organized into several tasks to guide the development process:

### Task 1: Project Overview and Demo

**Overview:** In this initial task, we provide an overview of the project and a brief demo of the web application. This serves as an introduction to the project and sets the stage for what the user can expect.

### Task 2: Turn Simple Python Scripts into Web Apps

**Overview:** This task involves transforming simple Python scripts into a web application using Streamlit. Streamlit is a Python library that makes it easy to create web applications with minimal effort.

### Task 3: Load the Twitter US Airline Sentiment Data

**Overview:** Here, we focus on data acquisition. We load Twitter data related to US airlines, which is essential for performing sentiment analysis. This step may involve using APIs or other data retrieval methods.

### Task 4: Display Tweets in the Sidebar

**Overview:** In this task, we work on the user interface by displaying the loaded Twitter data (tweets) in the sidebar of the web application. Users will interact with this data to initiate sentiment analysis.

### Task 5: Plot Interactive Bar Plots and Pie Charts

**Overview:** Task 5 involves data visualization. We use Plotly, a popular data visualization library, to create interactive bar plots and pie charts. These charts will visually represent the sentiment analysis results from the Twitter data.

### Task 6: Plotting Location Data on an Interactive Map

**Overview:** In this task, we enhance the data visualization by plotting location data from the tweets on an interactive map. This can provide geographical insights into the sentiment of tweets.

### Task 7: Plot the Number of Tweets by Sentiment for Each Airline

**Overview:** Task 7 focuses on aggregating and visualizing data by sentiment and airline. We create visualizations that show the number of tweets classified by sentiment for each airline, giving users a deeper understanding of sentiment distribution.

### Task 8: Word Cloud for Positive, Neutral, and Negative Tweets

**Overview:** In the final task, we create word clouds for positive, neutral, and negative tweets. Word clouds are a visually appealing way to display the most common words in each sentiment category, providing additional insights into the sentiment expressed in the tweets.

This project structure breaks down the development process into manageable tasks, each contributing to the overall functionality and usability of the web application for analyzing US airline-related tweets' sentiment.
